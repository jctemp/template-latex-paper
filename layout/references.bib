Setting the right course prevents problems from the outset and highlights the need for action in software testing. In addition to theoretical basics, this work shows the implementation in practice, deals with typical problems and explains decisive aspects to be considered in the test concept to optimally support and accompany the test process. The Contents Test documents according to {IEEE} 829 Test strategy, objectives, planning Designation of test concept and introduction Test organization Process description Test objects, phases and stages Performance characteristics Not tested features Prioritization of test cases Permanent test organization Acceptance criteria Criteria for test termination Test risks Data, documentation, tasks and environment for test Responsibilities, communication Personnel, induction, training Schedule/work plan Planning risks Approval/ release Project organization Test methods Maturity level of test management Test organization in agile projects Artificial intelligence, cognitive testing The Target Groups Stakeholders in {IT} projects, consultancies, universities, research institutes The Author Frank Witte has many years of experience in software testing in various companies and industries. For every new software project, it is necessary to comprehensively plan test activities and organize tests. Therefore, he has already written several test concepts himself and has experienced what is particularly important and which problems can be identified in advance at the beginning of test processes, but also proactively prevented or reduced},
